# Bloodbook
Bloodbook for Elden Ring




#What is Bloodbook?

The first Bloodbook was a metagame made by DreadedCone for Dark Souls II. It worked around "contracts" set up around certain locations and limitations upon players for invasions. Each of these limitations they completed or achieved gave them additional gold. This is inspired by said Bloodbook, but for Elden Ring instead.
